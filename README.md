p2pool-node-status
==================

An alternative clean p2pool node dashboard. It uses Bootstrap, jQuery and Highcharts.

### [Full demo here](http://bitcoin.d4rkn3t.com:9332/static/)

# Note

This dashboard requires the use of a custom p2pool fork (https://github.com/jramos/p2pool). The fork adds additional web interfaces for retrieving block and transaction information.

## Installation

Do this in the top directory of your p2pool installation:

``` Bash
git clone https://github.com/jramos/p2pool-node-status.git web-static
```

and access via `http://<url-to-your-p2pool>:<port>/static`

## Configuration

The `config.json` is found in `js` directory.

### Highlight your own miner address

If you want your miner address highlighted, adjust `myself` variable accordingly. E. g.

``` JavaScript
var config = {
  myself : [
    "***REMOVED***"
  ],
  node_name : '',
  reload_interval : 30,
  reload_chart_interval : 600,
  use_fontawesome : true,
  enable_audio : true,
  header_url : '',
  footer_url : ''
}
```

### Customize the node name

By default. no node name is displayed. To customize, set `node_name` equal to the value you want to display. Note that this does not affect the host setting in any way.

``` JavaScript
var config = {
  myself : [],
  node_name : 'bitcoin.d4rkn3t.com:9332',
  reload_interval : 30,
  reload_chart_interval : 600,
  use_fontawesome : true,
  enable_audio : true,
  header_url : '',
  footer_url : ''
}
```

### Adjust the reload interval

Per default the UI updates the miner list and server stats every 30 seconds.  You can adjust the `reload_interval` variable like

``` JavaScript
var config = {
  myself : [],
  node_name : '',
  reload_interval : 20,
  reload_chart_interval : 1200,
  use_fontawesome : true,
  enable_audio : true,
  header_url : '',
  footer_url : ''
}
```

to set it to 20 seconds for example.

`reload_chart_interval` sets the amount of seconds until the hashrate graph is reloaded.  In above example, it's configured to 1200 seconds (20 minutes).

**Beware** that each API query puts network and CPU load on your p2pool installation.  Avoid decreasing this value too much.  In my tests, 20 to 30 seconds seem to be fair enough.

### Disable Fontawesome Bitcoin icon

On Bitcoin p2pools, this UI uses the Fontawesome Bitcoin icon per default.  This can be disabled per `use_fontawesome` configuration option.  Set it to false if don't want to use the bitcoin icon.

``` JavaScript
var config = {
  myself : [],
  node_name : '',
  reload_interval : 30,
  reload_chart_interval : 600,
  use_fontawesome : false,
  enable_audio : true,
  header_url : '',
  footer_url : ''
}
```

If this variable is set to `false`, the UI displays the p2pool currency symbol (BTC).

*This does only apply to Bitcoin pools.  On other cryptocurrencies, the UI displays whatever p2pool API replies as currency symbol.*

### Disable audio notifications

By default, audio is played when new shares or blocks are discovered. This can be disabled via the `enable_audio` configuration option. Set it to false if you don't want to hear audio notifications.

``` JavaScript
var config = {
  myself : [],
  node_name : '',
  reload_interval : 30,
  reload_chart_interval : 600,
  use_fontawesome : true,
  enable_audio : false,
  header_url : '',
  footer_url : ''
}
```

### Display a header and/or footer

By default, no header or footer are displayed. Add HTML to the files references by the `header_url` and/or `footer_url` configuration settings to display an HTML snippet at the top and/or bottom of each page.

``` JavaScript
var config = {
  myself : [],
  node_name : '',
  reload_interval : 30,
  reload_chart_interval : 600,
  use_fontawesome : true,
  enable_audio : true,
  header_url : 'header.html',
  footer_url : 'footer.html'
}
```

## Roadmap

- ~~Auto update node graph.~~
- ~~Add section for recent shares and share tree in network~~
- ~~More graphs for the p2pool node~~
- Replace HighCharts by another graph lib which can still be used on nodes having a fee (nodes considered as commercial)
